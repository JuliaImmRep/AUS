# AUS

## Overview
Antibody upstream sequence (AUS) repository contains all key python scripts in reproducing results in ***"Antibody Upstream Sequence Diversity and Its Biological Implications Revealed by Repertoire Sequencing"*** (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.02.280396). These scripts include those employed for AUS identification and filtration and those for characterizing the identified AUS from different species.
